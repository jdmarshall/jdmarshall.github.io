    <h2>Project #2: Orchestrate v1.0</h2>

    <p>
        From there we cast a bigger net.  Orchestrate was designed to cross-reference User Stories, code commits,
        CI builds, and code reviews.  With this it builds a story of "how is the project coming along?"
    </p>

    <h3>Design Criteria</h3>
    <p>
    </p>

    <div>
        <dl>
            <dt>Responsive</dt>
            <dd>
                First, we had to support everything from IE 7 to Mobile Safari.  It had to work on projectors.  And it
                had to do something useful with a 1650 pixel wide monitor. It's been more than 10 years since projectors
                became de facto standard in meeting rooms at software companies, and in that time price points have been
                the major innovation, color and brightness being secondary. Resolution has hardly budged. It's still
                very common for projectors to be 768 or 800 pixels high, and 1024 or 1280 pixels wide.  This puts them on
                par with tablets (which we were also targeting).
            </dd>
            <dt>Visibility</dt>
            <dd>
                I had a friend years ago who worked in ADA advocacy, and I knew someone who had a rare form of color
                blindness.  I also have a pet peeve about factory color settings on low- and mid-end projectors (in
                brief, they are awful, and almost nobody ever changes them).  Even for individuals of nominally 'normal'
                vision, there are challenges with contrast and hue on a 1024x768 monitor in a meeting room, especially
                one with windows.  Planning meetings can become stressful enough without everyone arguing about what the
                tiny text on the projector says (and I have witnessed this first hand on several projects).  Let's not
                make it worse.
            </dd>
            <dt>Navigation</dt>
            <dd>
                Unsurprisingly, each story has a detail page, where an exhaustive rundown of the story could take up
                the entire page.  For every other reference to the story we wanted a small 'widget' with a clearly
                marked mechanism to navigate to the detail page.
            </dd>
            <dt>Overview</dt>
            <dd>
                Navigation is great, but in a page of very homogeneous information, it's hard to know what or if you
                should look at. Whatever is displayed should give an indication of whether the item is 'interesting'
            </dd>
        </dl>
    </div>

        This design was a collaboration with our new UX Designer, <a href="schubox.com">Kevin Schumacher</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Vertically stacked blocks of similar text are nearly impossible to scan quickly.  I've known about this problem
        and saw it in Scrumworks.  I'm sure I've seen it discussed in UI literature, though I couldn't rightly say
        where. But shape and color changes 'catch' the eye and allow you to find things like section delimiters in text.
        It's one of the reasons hierarchical data always has a shape.  The color flash through a section of the field of
        vision that has seen only one solid color is seen as a distinct movement, and draws the attention.
    </p>
    <p>
        ScrumWorks had a saturated (blue) color bar band between sections that was just barely enough to catch your eye
        when scrolling quickly, and it helped tremendously.
