    <h2>CollabNet Orchestrate v1.0</h2>

    <p>
        From ScrumWorks we moved on to another project and cast a bigger net.  Orchestrate was designed to
        cross-reference User Stories, code commits, CI builds, and code reviews.  In a large organization, or any
        company with many customers, commitments have often been made to numerous third parties.  In a Continuous
        Delivery pipeline it can often be challenging for people to know how and when those commitments will finally be
        fulfilled.  "Is feature X in build Y or will it be in build Z?" is a common refrain, and in some organizations
        the onus is put onto the development team to provide these detailed reports.
    </p>

    <p>
        This question is in a category of interruption that developers find particularly frustrating, in large part
        because it can put a lot of project management activity onto the developer, and it takes some sophistication
        to answer the question in a way that isn't misleading or just plain wrong.   That sort of energy is better
        spent on requirements analysis, feature implementation, or bug fixes.  One pattern we have seen time and again
        is that you can count on a developer to use a tool if it provides them a direct benefit, and you can count on
        them to forget to use it if the personal benefit is ambiguous or non existent (and nobody uses a tool whose only
        purpose is enforcement).
    <p>
        We believed there was space in the tools ecosystem for tools that made it so that simply adhering a pretty
        commonly used development process would surface many of these details.  All of this information should be
        available so that interested parties could either be fed an existing status report or be trained in determining
        status on their own, leaving the devs to do what they do best.  The fact that Trac exists and had already
        achieved about 60% of the integrations that we were seeking to provide served as evidence that we were onto a
        winning idea.

    <h3>Design Criteria</h3>
    <p>
    </p>

    <div>
        <dl>
            <dt>Responsive</dt>
            <dd>
                Again, tablets were on the roadmap.  IE 8 and later were the targets, and the plan was to use a simpler
                page design so that less Javascript was involved in layout.
            </dd>
            <dt>Visibility</dt>
            <dd>
                While this product was not expected to be front and center in a project planning meeting, we anticipated
                that it could make an appearance in retrospectives, bug triage meetings, and other "things aren't going
                well" types of meetings.  More importantly, the primary views were going to pack a large number of
                similar looking items into a small space, so they needed to support perusal - someone glancing over a
                page (one with a scrollbar) looking for something in particular or for a pattern of behavior.
            </dd>
            <dt>Navigation</dt>
            <dd>
                Once again we have an overview page and a detail page, and it needs to be obvious where you are in the
                site, what you're looking at, and (hopefully) how you got here.
            </dd>
            <dt>Overview</dt>
            <dd>
                Navigation is great, but in a page of very homogeneous information, it's hard to know what or if you
                should look at. Whatever is displayed should give an indication of whether the item is 'interesting'
            </dd>
        </dl>
    </div>

    <h3>Design Proposal</h3>

    <figure class="example">
        <img title="CollabNet Orchestrate" src="assets/images/orchestrate.png"/>
        <figcaption><a href="assets/images/orchestrate.png">Bigger and cleaner</a></figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        This design was a collaboration with our new UX Designer, <a href="schubox.com">Kevin Schumacher</a>
        Nearly every pixel in the figure to the right came from his brain and was implemented my me in the earliest
        iterations of HTML5 and CSS3. Not even flexbox yet. The positioning of the 4 and the 2 still haunts my dreams.
    </p>

    <h4>Shapes</h4>

    <p>We kept the 'badge' concept from ScrumWorks and distilled it.</p>
    <p>
        We wanted a distinctive identification treatment for each concept in the system.  We knew that each 'kind' of
        activity in the system would have different details and hence a different format. We knew that a lot of
        information for each activity was going to be textual, and we knew that the user needed to be able to quickly
        identify where they were and what they were looking at, so we didn't want the 'kind' information to be text as
        well.
    </p>

    <p>
        So we gave each activity type an icon.  Each icon had a different color scheme (blue, purple, green, gold, gray)
        and a unique silhouette.  We wanted you to be able to sit in the back of a room and be able to have a rough idea
        of what was going on even if you forgot your glasses.  We used negative space to separate the high level and
        detail information.
    </p>

    <h4>Color and Motion</h4>
    <p>
        One thing that was driven home for me on the ScrumWorks project was a particular detail of how humans scan a
        large volume of data looking for a particular entry or a group.  Absent a very good search engine (one that can
        find synonyms and typos), we tend to scroll and look for an item, but if you scroll too fast you're not actually
        seeing the content anymore. Technically, you're not even seeing shapes anymore. The part of your brain
        responsible for detecting movement has taken over. The motion part of your brain mostly detects fast transition
        in brightness. This is why you can scan over heirarchical data so fast; your brain detects the alternating text
        and white space (due to indentation levels) even when the page is flying past your eyes.  As the black text on
        the left edge of the page disappears and is replaced by a white background, or vice versa, your visual cortex
        mistakes it for motion and immediately draws your attention, as if spotting a lion moving in the grass.
    </p>

    <figure class="example">
        <img title="CollabNet Orchestrate Detail page" src="assets/images/orchestrate_detail.png"/>
        <figcaption>Detail view</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        In the ScrumWorks planning page, we had a columnar view with subsections, and each subsection had a header with
        a very different brightness and saturation than the content. It also had a different indentation. Taken as a
        whole, the effect was that the subsection header would 'catch' they eye while you were scrolling. In the
        Orchestrate situation we have a flat timeline, or activity log, and it's only in the detail views where the
        structure is evident. So order, color and brightness have to suffice to reveal the implied structure. When you
        see something that appears interesting or unusual about the order of events in the system, you can click through
        to a detail page where your suspicions will either be confirmed or invalidated.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, in your project activity log, if a build follows 3 commits, and then another build, odds are very
        good that the 3 commits are part of the most recent build.  If the build failed, one of those three commits is
        probably the culprit.
    </p>

    <h2>Commentary, Lessons Learned</h2>

    <h3>Color constants should be defined very carefully</h3>
    <p>
        With Orchestrate we were initially given carte blanche, except for the color scheme. Against our advice, the
        business wanted a design with lots of background colors.  At the first internal demo they decided the design was
        too busy, and they agreed that 'mostly white with colors for effect' was the right solution.  I thought
        we had made allowances for this eventuality in the stylesheets, but found out how very wrong I was.  It turns
        out that inverting a color palette on an entire website can be a tricky thing, even when you plan for it.  We
        had a period of weeks where we ended up with white text on a white background, followed by another week of dark
        text with inverted shadows making legibility <em>worse</em> instead of better.  As part of fixing this, and
        since we were already using Sass, we decided that, just as with CSS classes, color constant declarations should
        have been defined by their <em>purpose</em>, not by their qualities. What's the dominant foreground color, and
        what's the dominant background color, with a set of gradients, shadows and accent colors built off of that
        foundation. They should contain no adjectives about whether they were, for instance, light or dark.
    </p>

    <h3>Sometimes you win and lose at the same time</h3>
    <p>
        One of the problems with research projects is that sometimes your boss's boss pays for something that they
        ultimately don't want.  Doing research in a remote office makes this all the more likely. While one part of the
        organization wanted to experiment with fresh UI concepts, the flagship product has a very distinct look and
        there were some upset people who expected Orchestrate to look exactly like the main product line.  Much of our
        best work ended up being removed in later versions of the product, and much of what survives today is the
        analytics and data gathering parts of the application.
    </p>

    <h3>Rails is interesting, but not always in a good way</h3>
    <p>
        On a more personal note, we chose Ruby on Rails for this project, which represented quite a learning curve for a
        lot of us.  Unfortunately we also chose a nonstandard database which only supported about half of the
        ActiveRecord spec, making much of the standard Rails advice and resources like StackOverflow far less effective.
        While about half of us predicted this would be a problem at the start and unfortunately we lost out due to
        seniority.  While I don't currently use Rails, I still miss certain features of the templating engine (like
        content_for and other transclusion features) and try to encourage Single Page App library maintainers to
        adopt similar features.
    </p>
    <p>
        What I don't miss about Rails is the very bad discoverability situation.  'Discoverability' is a hard to
        quantify quality of a body of code that causes you to ask important questions. Upon seeing one part of the code,
        you are inspired and encouraged to follow the trail to other parts of the code and by this process you
        <em>discover</em> how the entire system actually works.  In a system with poor discoverability you are eternally
        beholden to the authors when things are inexplicably not working.  Many many times you had to interrupt other
        developers (especially leads) to figure out why a piece of code was failing silently, because some bit of magic
        in the system had stopped working and no amount of debugging was going to show you where the problem was.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the interview process we often award extra points for people who are self-starters.  If those self-starters
        cannot achieve mastery of the system without constant interactions with the leads, then your project management
        structure cannot scale.  One lead in particular was constantly swamped with requests for pairing sessions.
