## Professional

As a Software Engineer, my job boils down to finding repetitive, slow, tedious, and sometimes 
confusing tasks and translating them into code. Code never gets tired, and always avoids the same 
mistakes. When I think of developers 'Working Smarter, not Harder', I mostly picture developers
applying these same skills to their own tasks, their own problems. And when I think of projects
grinding to a halt over time, seeing mean time to bugfix creeping up and up, month after month, I 
mostly picture developers who are unable, or unwilling, to [sharpen their saws](https://www.franklincovey.com/courses/the-7-habits/habit-7/).

### Writing

I've had many rewarding experiences working with progressive managers who understand this set of
problems. Some of my writing here are informed by those conversations and interactions, and some of
my writing is transcription of my feedback to them, to peers, and to other software leaders in my
conversations and interactions with them.

I have done extensive work in team building, and the Software Development Lifecycle, including 
studying under and working closely with two published authors in the Kanban space. 

Much of how I think is contained in my posts about [Development](/development) and [DX](/dx).

But some of my writing delves into how I learned to learn. Here are a few:

<ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      {% for post in site.posts %}
        {% if post.topics contains "Growth" %}
          <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
       {% endif %}
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>

### Open Source

I am the creator of [faceoff](https://github.com/cobblers-children/faceoff), a maintainer of 
[node-config](https://github.com/node-config/node-config), [bench-node](https://github.com/RafaelGSS/bench-node), and a frequent contributor to 
[prom-client](https://github.com/siimon/prom-client).

## Influences

For distributed computing, I was fortunate to find formal training available in my college
curriculum, which I have only realized of late is not an option that was afforded to many of my
peers. And while that makes sense for my older peers, I find this somewhat shocking for younger ones
who started school after the dawn of this era of Cloud Computing.

For performance, introductory computer classes often struggle with consistent difficulty, and my
study buddy and I made a game out of making the easier assignments more difficult by handling 
larger inputs or returning faster results. My early career featured a good deal of work in making
fast applications in ‘slow’ languages.

For human factors, my attention turned from there to effectiveness over efficiency, and the ways in
which poor design can make it challenging for users to achieve what they meant or needed to
accomplish. Alan Cooper and Don Norman came onto my radar, and I had many chats with peers and
acquaintances with forms of color blindness or other visual acuity limitations. While not an expert
in accessibility, I know enough to avoid many common mistakes.

For data visualization, long ago in a discussion about how terrible a particular graph was, I was
introduced to Darrell Huff’s book, “How to Lie with Statistics”, and that sent me down a rather long
road, and probably was part of my influence in human factors in general. Edward Tufte, in addition 
to his books, used to write/blog online, and I followed him for many of his active years. And while
I often wouldn’t otherwise include Richard Feynman in this particular list, his warning about how 
you are the easiest person to fool, overshadows all when I think of data analysis.

For Software Engineering, I particularly appreciate the works of Kevlin Henney, Michael Feathers, 
Martin Fowler, Kent Beck, Jim Highsmith (paradoxes versus problems) and a number of mentors I’ve had
along the way, as well as many of the people I’ve mentored in turn. Teaching is a form of learning,
and we often don't understand our own ideas without having defended them.

## Personal

I am rediscovering the importance and pleasure of Going Outside. I’ve spent an inordinate amount of 
time on Permaculture, which is at its heart Systems Thinking as applied to gardening. The banner 
picture is one I took a long time ago at the [Japanese Garden](http://www.seattle.gov/parks/parkspaces/japanesegarden.htm) at the University of
Washington Arboretum.
