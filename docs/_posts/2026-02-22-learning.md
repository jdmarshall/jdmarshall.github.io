I had my first intervention at 8 years old, and it probably changed my life. 

Everyone knows the cliché story of the smart kid who almost gets held back and then gets tested, so
I will spare you another retelling. But there was also a parent-teacher conference around that time,
and that was something else entirely. I was sat down to discuss why my test scores were lower than
my class participation would suggest, and why I had trouble with certain subjects.

I was a very earnest and dogmatic child up until this point. If a grownup told me something, it was
so, and if I couldn't grasp it that was my fault rather than theirs. It was somewhere in the middle 
of the brainstorming session in that meeting when I realized that teachers are human too, and
therefore they could be wrong. It opened a door in my brain that I didn't even know was there, and
I started questioning everything. About facts, about mnemonics, about 'good ways to think about' a
concept.

Over the next few years my learning style evolved into hypothesis checking. I would focus more on
the examples the teachers gave and less on their unboxing of those ideas, and instead come up with
my own models and then compare them to subsequent examples, abandon that theory and try another.
Sometimes I would see the potential flaw and ask, "what about" questions to see if I was on track
or hallucinating. By the end of grade school I already had a tidy little lock on Theory of a System.

Hypothesis testing is the Scientific Method, and it's also one of the twin pillars of debugging
(the other being cost-benefit analysis). Theory of a System is architecture, it's project survival,
and it's how you get to be a Staff, Principal, or Lead engineer. It's how I as a part-time employee
and undergrad ended up being sent to all of the planning meetings for my first project, sometimes
instead of my boss, who was the PM.

I kind of got into tutoring and then mentoring as an accident. I would overhear another kid say they
didn't understand something the teacher said and I would butt in and say things like, "that didn't
make sense to me either, until I thought about it like this..." Sometimes it would stick, sometimes 
they'd go away just as confused. But when it worked I got a nice little hit of social 
neurotransmitters that made me try again the next time. And how I ended up tutoring my gaming
partner for more than a year because we couldn't play games until he turned in his CS homework. 

(Incidentally, UIUC had very harsh and broad rules about cheating, and over this time we developed 
an ethically defensible cleanroom protocol to ensure that I could not copy from him and he - nor for
that any of the other kids in the lab who overheard us and started asking me questions too - could
copy from me. If you had a compiler error, I would tell you what it meant and give you a hint. I
wouldn't help you solve the problem. If you were double dereferencing or not dereferencing a 
pointer, I would tell you, because the class wasn't about C it was about algorithms. I might go so 
far as to tell you if you were hot or cold (what you're doing isn't going to work and you should 
start over). And since my homework had already been submitted before I would look at anyone else's,
I couldn't feed anything I learned from their code back into mine. So you got me from when I was 
done until he was done, and then we'd go play for the rest of the evening and into the early
morning.)

I was already by this point not about the grade, so I either 'got' the homework assignment or I 
didn't (though mostly the former). I was about learning things I expected to need as a professional,
which meant I sometimes snoozed through half hour rambling discussions about things coworkers had
already told me were BS, only to latch onto a two sentence aside like a starving man to a crust of
bread. That wasn't even on the test.

## The Five Stages of Learning

There's a now infamous paper that lays out five stages of learning, beginning with rote memorization
and ending with generalization/improvisation - being able to reason about new scenarios that you
haven't seen before and accurately predict what the outcome will be.

This paper has been picked apart by people with degrees in human cognition and education, but the
thing that immediately bothered me about these complaints is that none of them saw what the most 
obvious flaw was to me: being able to talk about learning as a process is unarguably itself a stage
of learning. Which is to say, the paper they wrote about the 5 stages was itself a 6th stage, and 
then applying that paper to learning new things is, in by opinion at least, a 7th stage. 5 out of 7
ain't bad, but it isn't great either.

## Great Artists Steal

As I said in [Branching Out](/2013/09/11/branching-out.html), there are a lot seemingly independent
disciplines that should inform each other. A lot of human progress ends up being presented as 
anecdotes about some guy whose parents were goatherds and he found some way to apply goat herding 
theory to... making candy canes. Lightbulbs. Project Management. Whatever. 

This is not an accident. These silos monopolize human progress into narrow domains that can be just
as useful or perhaps moreso in others. DNA tests are built on a foundation of elements of the 
Burrows-Wheeler Transform from the field of data compression - and they *aren't using it to compress
the data*, they're using it to reassemble proverbial shredded paper back into complete DNA 
sequences. 

## Domains Are Not as Special as We Pretend

But more than that, how you learn about compression can also be how you learn about genetics. I 
think this is the thing that so-called polymaths (of which I consider myself to be a poor example, 
but an example nonetheless) understand that the rest of us have had beaten out of us. You can 
systemetize the study of a new topic using the skills you developed learning another.

This doesn't always translate. There are probably classes, and some domains contain multiple 
classes. You can't intellectualize your way through learning taijiquan or meditation for example, 
but once you know one of those, you can apply the lessons to learning about self-care, mental 
health, physical therapy, running, swimming. And if you can do that, you can apply some of them to
project management, training, documentation, and, believe it or not, how to run a War Room.

When, for instance I'm thinking about tech debt, there's a crotchety 'old' (I think he was 28) 
bicycle mechanic named Bob who taught me about [mis-en-place](https://www.cordonbleu.edu/malaysia/the-importance-of-mise-en-place/en)
without even knowing the term, and mostly by yelling and muttering about the stupid kids he had to
babysit. At the time I thought I hated Bob, but now I probably owe him an apology and a thank you,
because this concept is foundational to how I approach [DX](/dx) and particularly Discoverability.
