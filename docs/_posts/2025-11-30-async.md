In the previous article, I very briefly described a bunch of concepts in distributed computing but 
before we get to the meat of this series, there's an elephant in the room that I have so far 
ignored.

## The Global Interpreter Lock.

With very few exceptions, languages like Ruby or Node.js can really only do one thing at a time.
Node.js uses libuv to do some blocking system calls and parts of network requests in the background,
but everything else happens in a single thread. You cannot make a fetch while processing the 
result of another, and so there are certain sorts of latency you have to watch out for. All you have
available to you is cooperative multitasking, and if you want to do anything more performant than
some basic async code, accomplishing this without making your code look completely alien to all of
your current and future coworkers, if not also yourself, is quite challenging.

This is where libraries like p-limit or throat come in.
