In [Part 3](/2025/12/04/part3.html) we discussed heterogeniety and some other tuning tricks. Now
it's time for some of the rest of the story.

## The Mopping Up

None of the concepts I've discussed so far are a magic wand to deal with the limitations of the 
single threaded model in Node.js. Task switching is more administrative overhead, as it is in
any programming language. You only get more work done when you have tasks alternating between
being IO bound and CPU bound, and the factor is ofter relatively small, on the order of 2x. 
So take some care with your chunk sizes, in both directions.



## Conclusions

Special thanks to [Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus), an open source author who 
demonstrates Single Responsibility Principle in his Node.js modules with a consistency I have rarely
seen in the wild. Please check out his work, particularly [p-limit](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-limit)
and [p-retry](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-retry).
