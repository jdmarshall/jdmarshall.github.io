## Or, How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love the New Developer

The first task I complete at any new job is fixing the onboarding docs. 

### Tribal Knowledge

### Working Set vs Memorization

This, incidentally, also neatly explains why some devs can become antagonistic to the idea of 
refactoring of code - you are moving around things that are already part of their Tribal Knowledge
and now they will have a harder time working with them in the future. 

It's not enough to refactor code, you have to improve its discoverability as well, so the old hands
and the new ones can figure out where the code that used to live here has gone to. Which functions
I need to read to narrow down why the second argument is not being set and causing an exception
to be thrown.
