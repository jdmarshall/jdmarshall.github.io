During my absence, I did a bit of writing for my last employer, one is about [running Jenkins
entirely in Docker](https://github.com/dev9com/docker-jenkins) (including automated tests) and 
another one on [Jasmine Matchers](https://github.com/dev9com/jasmine-matchers).

Running Jenkins headless is a pretty cool trick, especially for a young team, but I had a surprising
amount to say about what goes into writing a good Matcher for a unit test framework. There are so
many ways to get it almost right and cause your teammates a lot of grief and they try to figure out
why their tests actually failed.

If you have a moment, check them out. They’re worth a read.
