    <h2>Project #1: Scrumworks Pro, versions 6.0, 6.1</h2>

    <p>
        Most of my front-end work has been in fairly densely related data, and the presentation concerns that come
        with it. Both of my projects at CollabNet were project management tools, a problem space and workflow that I was
        personally well acquainted with.
    </p>

    <h3>Design Criteria</h3>
    <p>
        In ScrumWorks, 'version 1' of the new web interface was intended for daily use by developers, and biweekly use
        during a planning meeting.  Just in that one sentence are a number of pretty substantial constraints on the
        design.
    </p>

            <dd>
                First, we had to support everything from IE 7 to Mobile Safari.  It had to work on projectors.  And it
                had to do something useful with a 1650 pixel wide monitor. It's been more than 10 years since projectors
                became de facto standard in meeting rooms at software companies, and in that time price points have been
                the major innovation, color and brightness being secondary. Resolution has hardly budged. It's still
                very common for projectors to be 768 or 800 pixels high, and 1024 or 1280 pixels wide.  This puts them on
                par with tablets (which we were also targeting).
            </dd>
            <dt>Visibility</dt>
            <dd>
                I had a friend years ago who worked in ADA advocacy, and I knew someone who had a rare form of color
                blindness.  I also have a pet peeve about factory color settings on low- and mid-end projectors (in
                brief, they are awful, and almost nobody ever changes them).  Even for individuals of nominally 'normal'
                vision, there are challenges with contrast and hue on a 1024x768 monitor in a meeting room, especially
                one with windows.  Planning meetings can become stressful enough without everyone arguing about what the
                tiny text on the projector says (and I have witnessed this first hand on several projects).  Let's not
                make it worse.
            </dd>
            <dt>Navigation</dt>
            <dd>
                Unsurprisingly, each story has a detail page, where an exhaustive rundown of the story could take up
                the entire page.  For every other reference to the story we wanted a small 'widget' with a clearly
                marked mechanism to navigate to the detail page.
            </dd>
            <dt>Overview</dt>
            <dd>
                Navigation is great, but in a page of very homogeneous information, it's hard to know what or if you
                should look at. Whatever is displayed should give an indication of whether the item is 'interesting'
            </dd>
        </dl>
    </div>

    <h3>Design Proposal</h3>

    <figure class="example">
        <img title="ScrumWorks Pro" src="../assets/images/blog/scrumworks.png"/>
        <figcaption>Everything about a user story in 4 lines</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        We ended up with a 4 line design, similar to what you see on the right.  This is not my design, but it has my
        fingerprints all over it.  At the time I was fascinated with the way modern board and card games lay out
        information (it is common for UX experiments to run in games and then be adopted by the mainstream later).  Many
        different qualities and quantities are stuffed into a rectangle the size of a playing card, and each card puts
        the same information in the same spots and in the same manner, but different kinds of information receive
        different treatments that are easily distinguished from one another, upside down on the other side of the table.
        A story 'tile' on a projector isn't a terribly different problem.
    </p>

    <h4>Header</h4>
    <p>
        The top line has the story ID and link to the detail page. The arrow next to the number was the application's
        convention for links that cause a navigation rather than opening something in-pane.  The ID is really the only
        field that grows, so it is the fluid element in this row (ie, it gets all of the 'extra' space).
    </p>
    <p>
        Next is the comment icon.  On a story with no comments, it is absent.  With one or more comments, it's always a
        fixed width, and we show a 1-2 digit number (1-99, '99+') centered over the icon representing the number of
        comments on the story, an indication of activity level.  This is the only block that disappears, meaning that
        all elements are always in the same positions.  This element has a contrast problem that no other element
        possesses:  It's white text on a dark grey background.  A very difficult color combination for legibility.
    </p>
    <p>
        What you can't see in the screen shot is that I'm using an extremely subtle black text shadow to increase the
        legibility.  It's so subtle in fact that you can't see it unless I turn it off an on while you watch, but you
        can definitely see that the text is 'crisp' with it and 'fuzzy' without.  It's one of my favorite CSS tricks,
        and it also works with dark text on a grey background (with a white shadow), and in situations where saturation
        is a problem (eg, off-white text on deep blue).
    </p>
    <p>
        The third segment is the number of tasks on the story.  This is always shown (the absence of tasks is itself
        'interesting').  This field grows to the number of tasks, but in practice while stories grow to 5 digits on a
        long project (more if you share a SW instance with other teams), more that 100 tasks on a single story is
        virtually impossible.
    </p>

    <figure class="example screenshot">
        <img title="Planning Column" src="../assets/images/blog/planning.png"/>
        <figcaption>Current version</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        The 'points' on the story was a contentious issue.  It's the estimate for this story, almost always a 1 or 2
        digit number (although 3 is legal, most users find it impractical).  We wanted it to stand out, especially in a
        planning meeting.  No icon we tried represented it well (and some distracted from the number).  Just having the
        number larger and bold helped (my preference), but not enough for everybody.  Since we still had about 80 pixels
        of free space, we ended up with the word 'EFFORT'.  Not long afterward we added an 'effort' sum to the top of
        the column with the word 'Effort' above it, and removed it from the tiles.
    </p>

    <h4>The body</h4>

    <p>
        We really wanted only one line for the title, but several problems presented.  First, a three line tile looked
        a little odd, like a strange macaroon.  But the main issue is that User Stories tend to get long titles, the
        most important words are often in the middle.  Some people are good at avoiding this pattern, but some do it
        habitually.  By going to two lines we end up with enough story title to differentiate them.
    </p>

    <h4>Themes and Status</h4>

    <p>
        In the bottom right corner we display the current status of the story.  This piece is variable, so we give it as
        much space as it wants. The rest of the line is the Themes.
    </p>

    <p>
        In ScrumWorks stories have tags called "Themes".  This ended up being the most technical bit to get right, and
        in the end it fell to me to fix it.  To help delimit them in the new and the old UI we put them in brackets.
        Often more than can fit in the available space. When their isn't enough space, we display something like:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <code>[Theme1, Theme2, Theme3, The...] In Progress</code>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Commentary, Lessons Learned</h2>

    <p>
        We changed course, technologically speaking, a couple times in this project.  Many of those lessons we took
        forward into the next one.
    </p>

    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <p>
        CSS is extremely powerful.  Often there are several ways to do something, but they don't necessarily work
        consistently on different browsers.  We also had a mix of expertise levels, from very high, to fairly low,
        and a mix of full stack developers who had different expectations as to how much HTML and CSS they were
        interested in knowing. Some wanted to learn anything you were willing to share, others were comfortable at
        their current level.
    </p>
    <p>
        We had to condense down our CSS to a subset of rules that everyone on the team could follow, and that worked
        everywhere.  We had a lot of block elements for fine control of vertical and horizontal spacing.  We used,
        almost exclusively, CSS classes both for our style and for jQuery selectors for two reasons.  First, so that
        people only had to know a very little about selectivity.  Second, every time we thought "Only one of this
        thing will ever appear on a page" and used IDs for jQuery selectors, we proven were wrong.  Fixing the
        problem was painful every time, and eventually only myself and one other engineer were willing and able to
        tackle them properly.
    </p>

    <figure class="example">
        <img title="Planning Column" src="../assets/images/blog/planning.png"/>
        <figcaption>Layout regressions</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        Vertical layout, and to a lesser extent, any pixel-accurate control of position, is still a guaranteed adventure
        in CSS.  It was challenging to get right, and if you look closely at the diagram at the right you'll see at least
        3 alignment issues (I count 4), each of which I had addressed during my time on the project.  It's taxing to
        maintain these sorts of relationships over a long period of time.
    </p>
    <p>
        On our next project we adopted Sass and Compass, which outright solved almost half of our layout issues, and
        made the others easier to manage.  Things like "Make this element X pixels tall, and make these two elements
        half that height" came down to pixel arithmetic in our Sass files.  Compass also made it dead simple both to
        get icon alignment right, but to avoid icon bleed when the User Agent is zoomed (sub pixel rendering can result
        in one line of pixels from a neighboring icon to display)
    </p>

    <h4>Client side HTML</h4>
    <p>
        Our app made use of Progressive Enhancement (mostly for network optimization, not for disabling Javascript),
        which unfortunately meant that many UI elements were implemented twice, once in JSP and once in jQuery.  Each
        would have different display bugs, especially around business logic, and occasionally with escaping characters.
        As we added deeper layers of functionality to the application the writing was on the wall and we had to step
        back.  Today this problem is a major selling point of 'isomorphic' frameworks, but those didn't yet exist.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over time we found many strategies to ameliorate these problems.  We established javascript style guidelines to
        make the code for generated HTML read a bit like a templating engine.  We eliminated some server rendering and
        moved it to the client.  We developed tricks to avoid the long stall typical of AJAX apps on initial page load.
        For instance on some pages we injected the initial JSON payload into the source, and the client would parse and
        render it without an additional round trip to the server.  On our next project we went much farther, with a
        single rendering engine and experimented more deeply with PJAX (loading HTML snippets from the server and
        pasting them into the current page).
    </p>

    <h4>Vertical feature teams</h4>

    <p>
        Another problem was getting the wrong data from the server.  Early in the project we split stories into front
        end and backend, but as most people soon realize, this causes logistical problems down the road.  To fill a
        display you have to have all of the information necessary in one place, and often interpreted just so.  Working
        in a vacuum, backend-only folk are often guilty of asking themselves "Is all the data for this page available?"
        instead of asking "Is all of the data for this page available in one or two round trips?"  Once someone has
        marked something 'Done' they resist reopening it.  And responsiveness suffers if the front end people have to
        ask the server questions before they can ask the question they really need answered, and interpreting data on
        the front end is a common source for having bugs.  The sort of bugs that keep coming back in different places.
    </p>

    <p>
        Integrating the development into a single story that delivers the feature all the way from disk drive to pixels
        avoids many of these problems.  It also resulted in less rework and retesting of our test plans, because the
        backend is only delivered once.
    </p>

    <h4>IE7 is Measurably Awful</h4>

    <p>
        All through the development process, I was keeping a rough count of both the number of browser specific issues
        and the amount of time spent fixing them.  A few issues showed up in Chrome (one that was difficult to fix)
        several times as many in Firefox, and the rest in IE.  But what really stood out was that the IE bugs took
        much, much longer to fix, upward of 5x as long, and one version in particular.  At the end of the day, I went
        to Victor with numbers:  almost 50% of effort spent on fixing single-browser issues was spent just on IE
        version 7.
    </p>

    <h4>Addendum</h4>

    <p>
        There were other lessons to learn from the project, but so often it takes us a long time to verbalize them, or
        event to identify them.  A few of these surfaced on the next project, <a href="orchestrate.html">CollabNet
        Orchestrate</a>
