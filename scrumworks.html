    <h2>Project #1: Scrumworks Pro, versions 6.0, 6.1</h2>

    <p>
        Most of my front-end work has been in fairly densely related data, and the presentation concerns that come
        with it. Both of my projects at CollabNet were project management tools, a problem space and workflow that I was
        personally well acquainted with.
    </p>

    <h3>Design Criteria</h3>
    <p>
        In ScrumWorks, 'version 1' of the new web interface was intended for daily use by developers, and biweekly use
        during a planning meeting.  Just in that one sentence are a number of pretty substantial constraints on the
        design.
    </p>

                First, we had to support everything from IE 7 to Mobile Safari.  It had to work on projectors.  And it
                had to do something useful with a 1650 pixel wide monitor. It's been more than 10 years since projectors
                became de facto standard in meeting rooms at software companies, and in that time price points have been
                the major innovation, color and brightness being secondary. Resolution has hardly budged. It's still
                very common for projectors to be 768 or 800 pixels high, and 1024 or 1280 pixels wide.  This puts them on
                par with tablets (which we were also targeting).
            </dd>
            <dt>Visibility</dt>
            <dd>
                I had a friend years ago who worked in ADA advocacy, and I knew someone who had a rare form of color
                blindness.  I also have a pet peeve about factory color settings on low- and mid-end projectors (in
                brief, they are awful, and almost nobody ever changes them).  Even for individuals of nominally 'normal'
                vision, there are challenges with contrast and hue on a 1024x768 monitor in a meeting room, especially
                one with windows.  Planning meetings can become stressful enough without everyone arguing about what the
                tiny text on the projector says (and I have witnessed this first hand on several projects).  Let's not
                make it worse.
            </dd>
            <dt>Navigation</dt>
            <dd>
                Unsurprisingly, each story has a detail page, where an exhaustive rundown of the story could take up
                the entire page.  For every other reference to the story we wanted a small 'widget' with a clearly
                marked mechanism to navigate to the detail page.
            </dd>
            <dt>Overview</dt>
            <dd>
                Navigation is great, but in a page of very homogeneous information, it's hard to know what or if you
                should look at. Whatever is displayed should give an indication of whether the item is 'interesting'
            </dd>
        </dl>
    </div>

    <h3>Design Proposal</h3>

    <figure class="example">
        <img title="ScrumWorks Pro" src="assets/images/scrumworks.png"/>
        <figcaption>Everything about a user story in 4 lines</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        We ended up with a 4 line design, similar to what you see on the right.  This is not my design, but it has my
        fingerprints all over it.  At the time I was fascinated with the way modern board and card games lay out
        information (it is common for UX experiments to run in games and then be adopted by the mainstream later).  Many
        different qualities and quantities are stuffed into a rectangle the size of a playing card, and each card puts
        the same information in the same spots and in the same manner, but different kinds of information receive
        different treatments that are easily distinguished from one another, upside down on the other side of the table.
        A story 'tile' on a projector isn't a terribly different problem.
    </p>

    <h4>Header</h4>
    <p>
        The top line has the story ID and link to the detail page. The arrow next to the number was the application's
        convention for links that cause a navigation rather than opening something in-pane.  The ID is really the only
        field that grows, so it is the fluid element in this row (ie, it gets all of the 'extra' space).
    </p>
    <p>
        Next is the comment icon.  On a story with no comments, it is absent.  With one or more comments, it's always a
        fixed width, and we show a 1-2 digit number (1-99, '99+') centered over the icon representing the number of
        comments on the story, an indication of activity level.  This is the only block that disappears, meaning that
        all elements are always in the same positions.  This element has a contrast problem that no other element
        possesses:  It's white text on a dark grey background.  A very difficult color combination for legibility.
    </p>
    <p>
        What you can't see in the screen shot is that I'm using an extremely subtle black text shadow to increase the
        legibility.  It's so subtle in fact that you can't see it unless I turn it off an on while you watch, but you
        can definitely see that the text is 'crisp' with it and 'fuzzy' without.  It's one of my favorite CSS tricks,
        and it also works with dark text on a grey background (with a white shadow), and in situations where saturation
        is a problem (eg, off-white text on deep blue).
    </p>
    <p>
        The third segment is the number of tasks on the story.  This is always shown (the absence of tasks is itself
        'interesting').  This field grows to the number of tasks, but in practice while stories grow to 5 digits on a
        long project (more if you share a SW instance with other teams), more that 100 tasks on a single story is
        virtually impossible.
    </p>

    <figure class="example screenshot">
        <img title="Planning Column" src="assets/images/planning.png"/>
        <figcaption>Current version</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        The 'points' on the story was a contentious issue.  It's the estimate for this story, almost always a 1 or 2
        digit number (although 3 is legal, most users find it impractical).  We wanted it to stand out, especially in a
        planning meeting.  No icon we tried represented it well (and some distracted from the number).  Just having the
        number larger and bold helped (my preference), but not enough for everybody.  Since we still had about 80 pixels
        of free space, we ended up with the word 'EFFORT'.  Not long afterward we added an 'effort' sum to the top of
        the column with the word 'Effort' above it, and removed it from the tiles.
    </p>

    <h4>The body</h4>

    <p>
        We really wanted only one line for the title, but several problems presented.  First, a three line tile looked
        a little odd, like a strange macaroon.  But the main issue is that User Stories tend to get long titles, the
        most important words are often in the middle.  Some people are good at avoiding this pattern, but some do it
        habitually.  By going to two lines we end up with enough story title to differentiate them.
    </p>

    <h4>Themes and Status</h4>

    <p>
        In the bottom right corner we display the current status of the story.  This piece is variable, so we give it as
        much space as it wants. The rest of the line is the Themes.
    </p>

    <p>
        In ScrumWorks stories have tags called "Themes".  This ended up being the most technical bit to get right, and
        in the end it fell to me to fix it.  To help delimit them in the new and the old UI we put them in brackets.
        Often more than can fit in the available space. When their isn't enough space, we display something like:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <code>[Theme1, Theme2, Theme3, The...] In Progress</code>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Commentary</h2>

    <figure class="example screenshot">
        <img title="Planning Column" src="assets/images/planning.png"/>
        <figcaption>Count the regressions</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        I'm a stickler for details, as was my boss on this project.  While prepping this material, I went to find some
        more images of ScrumWorks as it is today. I grabbed this screen capture and the first thing I noticed was that
        the text is all positioned wrong. 'In Progress' is too low.  All of the numbers are too high.  And the arrow
        icon is at least two pixels too low.  All of these were problems I remember fixing while on the project.  Layout
        in such close quarters is often harder than it looks.
    </p>

    <p>
        On our next project, we made a number of process changes to make layout a lot easier, including doing pixel
        arithmetic entirely with Sass, and using Compass for our icons.
