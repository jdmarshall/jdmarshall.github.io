    <h3>About Jason</h3>
    <p>
        I've been doing web applications for a long time.  <a href="https://innerjason.wordpress.com/2015/09/20/a-brief-history-of-jason/">Longer than most.</a>
        How we build web applications is changing rapidly these days.  Probably faster than it ever has.  When I started
        I mostly worked on the backend (an early Java adopter), including concurrency and deep dive performance
        analysis.  From there I got into security, information architecture, various flavors of Agile and Continuous
        Integration, Lead Development and mentoring.  I still enjoy all of these kinds of work, but discovered that I
        think spatially, and that I spend a great deal of time thinking about how people think.  So it was only a matter
        of time before I started doing some UX work.
    </p>

    <p>
        I spend a lot of time thinking about the process of writing software, and a lot of my work is in making the
        team function better.  Occasionally I <a href="http://innerjason.wordpress.com">write about it</a>, and I have
        a handful of new topics I'm working on, and some old ones I feel like I'm ready to revisit.  Expect more soon.
    </p>

    <h3>Organizing Information</h3>

    <figure class="example">

        <a href="scrumworks.html">
            <figcaption>ScrumWorks Pro: A user story in 4 lines</figcaption>
        </a>
    </figure>

    <p>
        Most of my front-end work has been in fairly densely related data, and the presentation concerns that come
        with it. When every piece of information is two degrees of separation from thousands of others, the biggest
        challenge is deciding what stays and what goes.  <em>Why</em> the person is looking at the application should
        dictate the organization of the data.  What should be front and center, and what they will drill down to see
        and what they might only care about once in a blue moon.  This requires a sense of organization, and a lot of
        thinking about thinking.
    </p>

    <p>
        Lots of factors go into seemingly simple displays of data.  Position, colors and shapes, font size and style.
        Proximity and spacing, similarity and dissimilarity. In some cases the biggest decision to get right is when to
        interpret data, and when to leave it up to the user to make a decision.  The wrong graph can undo an
        otherwise great piece of work.
    </p>

    <p>
        As you can probably tell, I'm not a graphic designer.  What I <em>am</em> good at is working with a designer to
        refine a preliminary design, by thinking about the personas, the workflow, and how humans process information,
        and also what the capabilities of our tools are.  A slightly 'better design' that takes much longer to implement
        and has ongoing costs associated with maintenance is no improvement at all.  Better to look for bigger wins
        elsewhere.
    </p>


    <h3>My Projects</h3>

    <p>
    There are a lot of people doing front-end work these days, and as a person who identifies as a
    <a href="#fullstack">full stack developer</a>, I usually don't get asked for a portfolio but times seem to be
    changing, so I've started to organize my recollections of the thought processes behind the designs, why we
    decided to do and how those decisions changed as we experienced the product firsthand.
    </p>

    <h4>International Systems Research, Zimple</h4>

    <p>
    ISR was one of the first companies to implement a templating engine for web applications, Zonar, based off of a
    paper a coworker delivered to the second W3C conference in Chicago. He hooked me up with ISR when they were
    pestering him for promising undergrads.
    </p>
    <p>
    They decided they wanted to also build a calendar management app, using a local web server and 3 Java Applets.
    When I showed up the first day the product was very far along, but they also gave me by far the slowest machine and
    on my screen I could literally watch the pixels render. I'd travelled halfway around the world for this job and I
    was suddenly worried about having my name on it. Much of what I know about Refactoring and perhaps half of what I
    know about performance I learned in a baptism by fire on this project. One weekend I wrote -500 lines of code, in
    service of replacing a copy-pasted code antipattern with quadratic runtime with a single implementation that I
    then replaced with one that was closer to nlogn. It would be a very long time before I landed a single commit with
    a larger performance impact.
    </p>

    <h4>Spacelabs Medical Telemetry Dashboard</h4>

    <p>
    "Let's show real time medical waveform data in an application written in an interpreted language", said no one ever,
    except apparently my new boss.
    </p>

    <p>
    Everyone - and I mean everyone - at the company, except for my boss, ostensibly his boss, and my new mentor
    thought Java was too slow to pull this off, and I said, "watch me". Java wouldn't even have a JIT for several years
    at this point. My boss had only promised the system would deliver smooth painting of 4 data streams at the same
    time. He <i>hoped</i> that we could some day deliver a larger dashboard that could show data from several patients
    at once, but he hadn't said that too loud to anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the end we not only hit 4 waveforms, smooth as glass, but if you flipped it to moving-hole mode (typical of older
    bedside monitors), we could run up to 16 waveforms at once. There was a lot of work on L7 parsing improvements,
    buffering of input data, and tickling the garbage collector so it didn't fire when we didn't want it to. But the
    biggest win was replacing direct draw first with double buffering and later with a ring-buffer, which I remembered
    from a class in college.
    </p>

    <h4>Washington Appelate Court</h4>

    <p>
    My Second System Syndrome. As they say in the book Good to Great, you can't escape mediocrity without Confronting
    the Brutal Facts.
    </p>

    <p>
    I won't torture myself too much here but let me just say:  They needed a web application to process the docket for
    the Court of Appeals. I told them they needed a web application. My boss told them they needed a web application.
    The employees would have been much happier and more employable learning to build a web application. But what they
    wanted was a 'native' application in Java. So we gave them what they wanted, and they changed their minds about the
    requirements so often that rework was killing morale, and so, "resilience to design changes" became one of the most
    important system requirements behind, "works and doesn't let people delete their criminal records."
    </p>

    <p>
    So what I gave them was a built on the new idea of Bean Properties that Sun Microsystems insisted would take over
    the world any minute. It was essentially a Reactive system, built on events, way before we had solved enough
    problems in degenerate cases for Event systems to make them popular. So I still have some things to say about
    worst-case behavior in event-driven systems, that were reinforced by the next few such systems I encountered.
    </p>

    <p>
    I met two gentlemen who replaced me on that project at a Java User's Group meeting. They asked, "You're Jason,"
    looked at each other meaningfully, and then confessed that they'd deleted the front-end engine that I built and
    replaced it with a website. I just nodded and told them, "Yeah I told them they needed a web application." Luckily
    I did plenty of respectable work on the backend of that system, including an isomorphic validation engine and heaps
    of optimizations, one of which I still use to this day as an anecdote for why you cannot trust the statistics in
    profilers.
    </p>

    <h4>4thPass K-Browser</h4>

    <p>
    I became an employee of 4thPass, a company famous for making one of the best code obfuscators for Java. I started
    day one, expecting to work on issues of low-level code, but found out that they had pivoted away from this to two
    other projects. The newest was an app store for cellphones, about 4 years before the iPhone was introduced. I would
    later become a Lead on this project, but the other was the KBrowser, and its maintainer had just been promoted to
    Architect.
    </p>

    <p>
    Kbrowser was a tiny web browser for PalmOS, and he was partway through accomplihing two things: rewrite it in J2ME
    to support phones, and port it to the new xhtml-basic format that was trying to send WML and WAP to a much deserved
    rest. Since I had 'worked on a browser before', (only partly true) they thought I would be a good fit for this
    project. I... did not. But this would be the second of three lessons in my career that sometimes other people are
    better judges of what I may or may not be good at than I am.
    </p>

    <p>
    I ended up systematically rewriting (again) the entire rendering engine, while the next person we hired wrote the
    CSS parser, and by the time we were done the screen paint time was almost indistinguishable from Openwave - the
    reigning mobile browser that was written in C, not an interpreted language. Lots of people cheered us on (apparently
    people were not fond of having Openwave as a vendor), but feature parity is challenging, when your competitor has
    ten times as many employees and a browser that is allowed to use 5 times as much disk space as your space allowance.
    This is the project where I solidified my claim that Java isn't slow, Java programmers are slow.
    </p>

    <p>
    I did get to work on that obfuscator after all. Because long before the feature backlog was empty, we had hit our
    kingly space allowance of 85 kilobytes - anything larger and the target phone would reject the install. Every new
    feature cost around 500 bytes, so before John or I could even think about writing new code, we first had to find
    half a kilobyte of space in the existing code. This became a brief period in my life where I could recite the Java
    Bytecode Specification chapter and verse. I found dozens of bugs in our code obfuscator that left prunable code,
    ways to rephrase blocks of code to generate shorter bytecode, ways to reorganize our class files to reduce
    duplication of large function signatures, replaced the J2ME menu system with an html page, and eventually, when
    every other rock had been turned, leveraged my knowledge of file compression to first tweak our prefix sorting of
    the constant pool, and subsequently switching to suffix sorting to squeeze the archive by another kilobyte.
    </p>

    <p>
    After merging with Motorola, RIM bought this code but they only wanted it for the WAP functionality, which largely
    predated me, to add to the nascent Blackberry browser. So to the best of my knowledge, a few of my bug fixes lived
    on in the Blackberry but far less of that code than I would have hoped.
    </p>

    <p>
    This job is also where I worked with two different people who would go on to write books on Agile Project
    Management, and I spent a <i>lot</i> of time talking to both of them.
    </p>

    <h4><a href="scrumworks.html">Scrumworks Pro</a></h4>

    <p>
        This was my second heavily interactive web application, and the first modern one.  Built on jQuery and jQueryUI,
        with substantial drag and drop and some pretty sophisticated layout logic. I gave it its own page.
    </p>

    <h4><a href="orchestrate.html">CollabNet Orchestrate</a></h4>
        For my third, we tried to design a web application to link work in progress to the feature lifecycle, so that
        all commits, Continuous Integration builds and code reviews were permanently tied to a user story.

    <h4>Other Projects</h4>
    <p>
        Subsequent to this I worked on several contracts with UI work, including Holland America's then-future
        brochure-ware website for exploring and booking cruises, and a CMS tool used internally at Disney. I also
        spent some time experimenting with early versions of web components, some of which I began to incorporate
        into a project for <a href="foodforest.html">Beacon Food Forest</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've done other UI work, not all of it web based, and a good deal of backend work.  I've also done some dataviz
        work, (Process guys always want graphs, and some graphs remind me of the old Mark Twain line about Lies, Damned
        Lies, and Statistics). This is covered in part in attempt to present my resume in
        <a href="https://innerjason.wordpress.com/2015/09/20/a-brief-history-of-jason/">short story form</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Organizations</h3>

    <h4><a href="http://cobblers-children.github.io/">The Cobbler's Children</a></h4>
    <p>
        "The Cobbler's Children Have No Shoes" is a lament about how craftsman spend so much time and energy on their
        customers that their own needs and those of their families suffers as a consequence. But I think the tragedy
        here is deeper than this; if we don't insist on high quality tools for ourselves then how do we expect to be
        inspired to produce high quality tools for our users? You don't use sticks and rocks to craft high-end
        furniture, but we sure try.
    </p>

    <p>
        When I created this github group, the term Developer Experience was still all but unknown. I had intended to
        recruit people to help me with this plan. I even proposed to a technical book club I belonged to that we begin
        code reviewing open source data sets, doing a sort of Comparative Literature for code, and then submitting
        pull requests to improve the code even more. But unfortunately they were not interested at the time.

        I'm very interested in applying UX principles to developer tools. I believe that better tools means better
        software, and that we have been neglecting issues around tool quality for too long now. I would like to try
        adain to recruit some of my old colleagues into helping me get organized.
    </p>

    <h4><a href="foodforest.html">Beacon Food Forest</a></h4>
    <p>
        Most of my volunteer effort for years went to the Beacon Food Forest, an edible park just south of Downtown
        Seattle, which unfortunately is too far for me to commute now.
    </p>
    <p>
        In an effort to apply my professional skills to this project, I had been working on a set of tools for
        organizing, collecting, and displaying information about Food Forests in an approachable manner.
    </p>

    <h3 id="fullstack">What does &quot;Full Stack&quot; mean to me?</h3>

    <p>
        When I think 'Full Stack', or indeed when I'm looking for someone who labels themselves as full stack, I want
        them for one of two reasons.  On a big or complex project, I need people who can understand the entire
        application from top to bottom.  Someone who can reason about it, see failure modes and choke points to our
        success, and find concrete ways to improve the situation.  Someone who can help design the information
        flow within the system, simplifying the system and opening up new avenues for future features.  People who
        know one aspect of the problem can sit around saying that it's somebody else's responsibility to deal with it.
        A Full Stack person gets closer to the truth, and can offer multiple solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
        On a smaller project, I may not actually know what mix of skills I need for a successful project.  The mix may
        change from one milestone to the next, depending on the target audience.  In this case my Full Stack developers
        are also a hedge against bottlenecks.  They allow me to get my 'Bus Number' high without hiring a bunch of
        people I can't keep busy or would struggle to manage.  I value someone who's willing to expand or learn a skill
        to support the success of the entire team.  This week it might be setting up a build server.  Next it might be
        upgrading a database.  I might need extra hands to kick start a testing harness, or I might be behind on
        server side data validation.  I need someone who can either pick up a new task, or can at least help out the
        other folks by doing their own troubleshooting.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I say "I'm a full stack developer", these two areas are the qualities that I refer to.
    </p>

    <h4>My Skills and Experience</h4>
    <p>
        In addition to Human Factors, Analysis and Design, I have some small skill in system administration.  But one of
        the places I feel I excel is in root cause analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
        'Root Cause Analysis' is just a fancy way of saying "getting to the meat of a problem".  It requires an ability
        to effectively identify and eliminate theories that might explain a problem.  It requires a certain kind of
        devious mind, and a healthy dash of persistence.  I fix performance problems when everyone else has thrown their
        hands up in defeat.  I have worked on behalf of my employer with numerous vendors to identify bugs and
        performance issues from embedded systems like Aicas, to Wind River and a handful of Hardware Security Module
        manufacturers, to software and hardware vendors like F5.
    </p>
    <p>
        I like to solve hard problems, and find ways to make the team more effective.   I've maintained version control
        systems (once on my own dev machine), set up Continuous Integration environments and build pipelines for ten
        years. I've built developer tools, reusable libraries, instituted Process improvements, defined Code Review
        guidelines, established unit testing practices and spearheaded localization efforts.  I've built authentication
        frameworks, code signing tools, reverse proxy configurations and Docker images.  I've fixed more build scripts
        than I can rightly count, and it astounds me how consistently they possess the same set of bugs.
