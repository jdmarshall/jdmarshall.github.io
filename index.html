    <h3>Hi, I'm Jason</h3>

    <p>
        Currently I'm working on four things.  One is this little portfolio page.  Not much so far, but I'm
        still gathering material.  The second is a <a href="http://jdmarshall.github.io/hashing/">visualization of
        cryptographic hashes</a>, which I'm also using to explore the WebComponents specification.  The third is my
        <a href="http://innerjason.wordpress.com">blog</a> which has been going slow but I have a bunch of new
        material I'm working on.
    </p>
    <p>
        The last and the one I'm most proud of is a crowd sourced app I'm working on to gather information about
        edible plants in a reusable form.  That will be <a href="https://github.com/jdmarshall/foodforest">over here</a>
        in a few months.
    </p>

    <H3>About Me</H3>
    <p>
        I've been doing web applications for a long time.  <a href="https://innerjason.wordpress.com/2015/09/20/a-brief-history-of-jason/">Longer than most.</a>
        How we build web applications is changing rapidly these days.  Probably faster than it ever has.  When I started
        I mostly worked on the backend (an early Java adopter), including concurrency and deep dive performance
        analysis.  From there I got into security, information architecture, various flavors of Agile and Continuous
        Integration, Lead Development and mentoring.  I still enjoy all of these kinds of work, but discovered that I
        think spatially, and that I spend a great deal of time thinking about how people think.  So it was only a matter
        of time before I started doing some UX work.
    </p>

    <p>
        As you can probably tell, I'm not a graphic designer.  What I <em>am</em> good at is working with a designer to
        refine a preliminary design, by thinking about the personas, the workflow, and how humans process information,
        and also what the capabilities of our tools are.  A slightly 'better design' that takes much longer to implement
        and has ongoing costs associated with maintenance is no improvement at all.  Better to look for bigger wins
        elsewhere.
    </p>

    <h3>Organizing Information</h3>

    <figure class="example">
        <img title="ScrumWorks Pro" src="assets/images/scrumworks.png"/>
        <a href="scrumworks.html">
            <figcaption>ScrumWorks Pro: A user story in 4 lines</figcaption>
        </a>
    </figure>

    <p>
        Most of my front-end work has been in fairly densely related data, and the presentation concerns that come
        with it. When every piece of information is two degrees of separation from thousands of others, the biggest
        challenge is deciding what stays and what goes.  <em>Why</em> the person is looking at the application should
        dictate the organization of the data.  What should be front and center, and what they will drill down to see
        and what they might only care about once in a blue moon.  This requires a sense of organization, and a lot of
        thinking about thinking.
    </p>

    <p>
        Lots of factors go into seemingly simple displays of data.  Position, colors and shapes, font size and style.
        Proximity and spacing, similarity and dissimilarity. In some cases the biggest decision to get right is when to
        interpret data, and when to leave it up to the user to make a decision.  The wrong graph can undo an
        otherwise great piece of work.
    </p>

    <h4>Full Stack</h4>

    <p>
        When I think 'Full Stack', or indeed when I'm looking for someone who labels themselves as full stack, I want
        them for one of two reasons.  On a big or complex project, I need people who can understand the entire
        application from top to bottom.  Someone who can reason about it, see failure modes and choke points to our
        success, and find concrete ways to improve the situation.  Someone who can help design the information
        flow within the system, simplifying the system and opening up new avenues for future features.  People who
        know one aspect of the problem can sit around saying that it's somebody else's responsibility to deal with it.
        A Full Stack person gets closer to the truth, and can offer multiple solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
        On a smaller project, I may not actually know what mix of skills I need for a successful project.  In this case
        my Full Stack developers are also a hedge against bottlenecks.  I value someone who's willing to expand or learn
        a skill to support the success of the entire team.  This week it might be setting up a build server.  Next it
        might be upgrading a database.  I might need extra hands to kick start a testing harness, or I might be behind on
        server side data validation.  I need someone who can either pick up a new task, or can at least help out the
        other folks by doing their own troubleshooting.
    </p>

    <p>
        I like to solve hard problems, and find ways to make the team more effective.  When I say "I'm a full stack
        developer", these are the qualities that I refer to.  I've maintained version control systems (once on my own
        dev machine), set up Continuous Integration environments and build pipelines for ten years. I've built developer
        tools, reusable libraries, instituted Process improvements, defined Code Review guidelines, established unit
        testing practices and spearheaded localization efforts.  I've built authentication frameworks, code signing
        tools, reverse proxy configurations and Docker images.  I've fixed more build scripts than I can rightly count,
        and it astounds me how consistently they possess the same set of bugs.  All these things I have done and taken
        pride in doing well.
