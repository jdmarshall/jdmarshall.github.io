    <h3>About Jason</h3>
    <p>
        I've been doing web applications for a long time.  <a href="https://innerjason.wordpress.com/2015/09/20/a-brief-history-of-jason/">Longer than most.</a>
        How we build web applications is changing rapidly these days.  Probably faster than it ever has.  When I started
        I mostly worked on the backend (an early Java adopter), including concurrency and deep dive performance
        analysis.  From there I got into security, information architecture, various flavors of Agile and Continuous
        Integration, Lead Development and mentoring.  I still enjoy all of these kinds of work, but discovered that I
        think spatially, and that I spend a great deal of time thinking about how people think.  So it was only a matter
        of time before I started doing some UX work.
    </p>

    <p>
        I spend a lot of time thinking about the process of writing software, and a lot of my work is in making the 
        team function better.  Occasionally I <a href="http://innerjason.wordpress.com">write about it</a>, and I have
        a handful of new topics I'm working on, and some old ones I feel like I'm ready to revisit.  Expect more soon.
    </p>

    <h3>Organizing Information</h3>

        </a>

    <p>
        Most of my front-end work has been in fairly densely related data, and the presentation concerns that come
        with it. When every piece of information is two degrees of separation from thousands of others, the biggest
        challenge is deciding what stays and what goes.  <em>Why</em> the person is looking at the application should
        dictate the organization of the data.  What should be front and center, and what they will drill down to see
        and what they might only care about once in a blue moon.  This requires a sense of organization, and a lot of
        thinking about thinking.
    </p>

    <p>
        Lots of factors go into seemingly simple displays of data.  Position, colors and shapes, font size and style.
        Proximity and spacing, similarity and dissimilarity. In some cases the biggest decision to get right is when to
        interpret data, and when to leave it up to the user to make a decision.  The wrong graph can undo an
        otherwise great piece of work.
    </p>

    <p>
        As you can probably tell, I'm not a graphic designer.  What I <em>am</em> good at is working with a designer to
        refine a preliminary design, by thinking about the personas, the workflow, and how humans process information,
        and also what the capabilities of our tools are.  A slightly 'better design' that takes much longer to implement
        and has ongoing costs associated with maintenance is no improvement at all.  Better to look for bigger wins
        elsewhere.
    </p>


    <h3>My Projects</h3>
    
    There are a lot of people doing front-end work these days, and as a person who identifies as a
    <a href="#fullstack">full stack developer</a>, I usually don't get asked for a portfolio but times seem to be 
    changing, so I've started to organize my recollections of the thought processes behind the designs, why we 
    decided to do and how those decisions changed as we experienced the product firsthand.  
    
    <h4><a href="scrumworks.html">Scrumworks Pro</a></h4>

    <p>
        This was my second heavily interactive web application, and the first modern one.  Built on jQuery and jQueryUI,
        with substantial drag and drop and some pretty sophisticated layout logic.  
    </p>

    <h4><a href="orchestrate.html">CollabNet Orchestrate</a></h4>
        For my third, we tried to design a web application to link work in progress to the feature lifecycle, so that
        all commits, Continuous Integration builds and code reviews were permanently tied to a user story.   
    <p>
        
    </p>
    
    <h4>Holland America Booking Website</h4>
    
    <p></p>
    
    <h4><a href="hashing.html">Hashing Visualization</a></h4>
    
    <p>
        An attempt to visualize how cryptographic hashes function, for the layperson.  Also an experiment in building
        Web Components.  Source is available <a href="https://github.com/jdmarshall/hashing">on GitHub</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h4><a href="foodforest.html">Food Forest Info</a></h4>
    <p>
        This project is still in a prototype phase, but represents two projects.  One, a crowd sourced informational 
        repository for community outreach, and two, an interactive map application that pulls information from the 
        repository.  This is a long term volunteer effort and a substantial sink of my available free time.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Other Projects</h4>
    <p>
        I've done other UI work, not all of it web based, and a good deal of backend work.  I've also done some graph
        work, (Process guys always want graphs, and some graphs remind me of the old Mark Twain line about Lies, Damned
        Lies, and Statistics). I'm currently trying to document these experiences, like a version of my resume in
        <a href="https://innerjason.wordpress.com/2015/09/20/a-brief-history-of-jason/">short story form</a> that 
        explains my backend and process improvement work in ways I could never condense into three sentences.
    </p>

    <h3 id="fullstack">What does &quot;Full Stack&quot; mean to me?</h3>

    <p>
        When I think 'Full Stack', or indeed when I'm looking for someone who labels themselves as full stack, I want
        them for one of two reasons.  On a big or complex project, I need people who can understand the entire
        application from top to bottom.  Someone who can reason about it, see failure modes and choke points to our
        success, and find concrete ways to improve the situation.  Someone who can help design the information
        flow within the system, simplifying the system and opening up new avenues for future features.  People who
        know one aspect of the problem can sit around saying that it's somebody else's responsibility to deal with it.
        A Full Stack person gets closer to the truth, and can offer multiple solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
        On a smaller project, I may not actually know what mix of skills I need for a successful project.  The mix may
        change from one version to the next, depending on the target audience.  In this case my Full Stack developers
        are also a hedge against bottlenecks.  They allow me to get my 'Truck Number' high without hiring a bunch of
        people I can't keep busy or would struggle to manage.  I value someone who's willing to expand or learn a skill
        to support the success of the entire team.  This week it might be setting up a build server.  Next it might be
        upgrading a database.  I might need extra hands to kick start a testing harness, or I might be behind on
        server side data validation.  I need someone who can either pick up a new task, or can at least help out the
        other folks by doing their own troubleshooting.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I say "I'm a full stack developer", these two areas are the qualities that I refer to.
    </p>

    <h4>My Skills and Experience</h4>
    <p>
        In addition to Human Factors, Analysis and Design, I have some small skill in system administration.  But one of
        the places I feel I excel is in root cause analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
        'Root Cause Analysis' is just a fancy way of saying "getting to the meat of a problem".  It requires an ability
        to effectively identify and eliminate theories that might explain a problem.  It requires a certain kind of
        devious mind, and a healthy dash of persistence.  I fix performance problems when everyone else has thrown their
        hands up in defeat.  I have worked on behalf of my employer with numerous vendors to identify bugs and
        performance issues from embedded systems like Aicas, to Wind River and a handful of Hardware Security Module
        manufacturers, to software and hardware vendors like F5.
    </p>
    <p>
        I like to solve hard problems, and find ways to make the team more effective.   I've maintained version control
        systems (once on my own dev machine), set up Continuous Integration environments and build pipelines for ten
        years. I've built developer tools, reusable libraries, instituted Process improvements, defined Code Review
        guidelines, established unit testing practices and spearheaded localization efforts.  I've built authentication
        frameworks, code signing tools, reverse proxy configurations and Docker images.  I've fixed more build scripts
        than I can rightly count, and it astounds me how consistently they possess the same set of bugs.
