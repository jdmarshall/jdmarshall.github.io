    <p>
        I volunteered for more than 5 years at the <a href="https://www.beaconfoodforest.org/">Beacon
        Food Forest</a> in Seattle, one of the largest public permaculture projects in the world, and
        the genesis story of quite a few food forests from North America to Taiwan.
    </p>
    <p>
        There were only a couple people on the project who were technologists, and I had the idea to
        create an interactive map and a Wiki to describe the site. After I took OSU's permaculture
        certificate class, I spent some time working with SVG and trying to design my own wiki tool.

        Many garden management programs insist on rectilinear layout, and "There are no straight lines
        in nature," as the saying goes. This work explored building a map and a map builder using SVG and
        SVG icons, supporting vertical layering of plants, and with locations of and information about all
        of the plants in a particular garden.

    <h3>Concept</h3>
    <p>
        This work represented two fairly large subprojects. One, a crowd sourced informational repository
        for community outreach, somewhere between wikidata and a recipe website, and two, an interactive
        map application that pulls information from the repository.
    </p>
    <p>
        The idea was to make a tool that was for-pay for managing private land but free for nonprofits
        to host their information pages on.
    </p>
    <p>
        However after getting a new job stalled progress, and a mixup after cancelling a lost credit
        card, the domain name was not renewed and has been parked ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
        I hope to get back to this some day, but at the moment I am more focussed on a pair of personal and team
        productivity tools that borrows substantially from some of the design elements I explored in this project.
